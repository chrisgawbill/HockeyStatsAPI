# HockeyStatsAPI

Independent Express API service for HockeyStatsWebApp. It fetches and maps NHL data, manages the optional filesystem/Postgres cache and normalized domain persistence, serves the board-game auth/streak endpoints, and hosts the team-history AI endpoint.

## Local setup

This service uses Node, pnpm, and Python for the AI endpoint.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm test
pnpm start
```

The server listens on `PORT`, defaulting to `9000`.

## Database migrations

Set `CACHE_DATABASE_URL` in `.env`, then run:

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate
```

`DATABASE_URL` is used for normalized domain persistence when set; otherwise the service falls back to `CACHE_DATABASE_URL`. See `.env.example` for cache, database, AI, diagnostics, CORS-related deployment, and Google auth configuration.

## API

The service exposes standings, schedules, game details, teams, rosters, player statistics, stat leaders, diagnostics, team-history AI, and optional Google-authenticated board-game streak sync. The frontend should consume these routes through its configured `VITE_API_URL`; this repository does not contain frontend or design-library code.

## Deployment

Recommended Render Web Service commands:

- Build: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Start: `pnpm start`

Configure secrets and runtime values in Render's environment settings. Do not commit `.env` or credentials.
